# This script creates a symmetrical image by copying the information from the right side of the image
# to the left side.
# 
# It is particularly useful when manually correcting a spinal cord segmentation, because only the right
# part needs to be corrected, and then this script is run to correct the left part. 
# 
# For more context, see: https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/PAM50/issues/19
# 
# How to run:
#   cd where this script is located and run:
#   python symmetrize_cord_segmentation.py
#   This will generate the file "PAM50_cord.nii.gz"
